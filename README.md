### About
The soldat app is a companion app for the in person RPG. The app is designed to help players understand and manage their character, both in the creation process and as the character progresses.

### Usage
The app has two primary functions: Character Creation, and Character leveling. New characters must be created with some basic information like body type, skills, and benefits and detriments. Characters that have been created can then earn new abilities with experience. The app helps the player to manage the costs and selection of new abilities as they like.

### Disclaimer
This application has been a solo project, as such there is much less structure to the development process as would be expected in a team collaboration. Additionally, this project is from personal interest and the steps taken to build it may not necessarily match a professional level of software.
